First time doing a repository
Hello fellow humans.  My name is Phil.. I am a transfer students at Georgia Southern University studying Computer Science.  I am a retired Army Soldier of 21 years and a veteran of the War in Afghanistan.  After 2005, I was given the nickname "Ground Zero" (or Zero for short) because of how close I was to the point of impact during the 9/11 attack on the Pentagon (Apparently, being a 9/11 survivor was a huge deal while I was on Active duty).
